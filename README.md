It covers Matplotlib library and Seaborn library for data visualisation

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is mainly deployed for basic plotting. Visualization using Matplotlib generally consists of bars, pies, lines, scatter plots and so on. It is a graphics package for data visualization in Python. It is well integrated with NumPy and Pandas. The pyplot module mirrors the MATLAB plotting commands closely. Hence, MATLAB users can easily transit to plotting with Python.

Seaborn: Seaborn, on the other hand, provides a variety of visualization patterns. It uses fewer syntax and has easily interesting default themes. It specializes in statistics visualization and is used if one has to summarize data in visualizations and also show the distribution in the data. Seaborn: Seaborn is more integrated for working with Pandas data frames. It extends the Matplotlib library for creating beautiful graphics with Python using a more straightforward set of methods.

In this repository we covered basic understanding of both libraries with examples that is useful for data visualisation
